    """ distributed images docker """

Pour run distributed images with docker, you can use the following command:
```bash
docker run -d --name distributed_images \
  -p 8080:8080 \
  -v /path/to/local/images:/app/images \
  distributed_images_image
``` 
This command will run the `distributed_images_image` container in detached mode (`-d`), map port 8080 of the host to port 8080 of the container, 
and mount a local directory containing images to `/app/images` in the container. Make sure to replace `/path/to/local/images` with the actual path to your images on the host machine.
